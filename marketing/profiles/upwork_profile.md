# Proposal Templates

## Template 1: Email Automation

Hi [Name],

I read your job post about automating email management - this is exactly what I specialize in.

I've built email automation agents for several businesses that:
- Auto-categorize incoming emails (urgent, work, newsletters, etc.)
- Extract action items so nothing falls through cracks
- Draft responses for quick review and send

For a recent client, this reduced their email processing time from 2 hours/day to 20 minutes.

**For your project, I'd propose:**
- Discovery call to understand your email workflow (30 min)
- Custom agent configured to your categories and rules
- Integration with your email provider
- Testing and refinement
- Documentation and 30 days support

**Timeline:** 1 week
**Investment:** $[500-1500 based on complexity]

Happy to hop on a quick call to discuss. When works for you?

Best,
Andrew

## Template 2: Data Entry Automation

Hi [Name],

Your data entry challenge caught my attention - I've automated similar workflows for other businesses.

My data entry agents:
- Extract data from PDFs, images, and scanned documents
- Validate against your rules (format, required fields, ranges)
- Populate spreadsheets or databases automatically
- Handle 500+ documents per day with zero manual entry

**For your project, I'd build:**
- Document parser for your specific format
- Field extraction with validation
- Direct output to Google Sheets/Excel/your system
- Error flagging for edge cases

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks depending on document complexity
**Investment:** $[1000-2500]

I can share a quick demo of similar work. Would that be helpful?

## Template 3: General Automation

Hi [Name],

I help businesses automate repetitive tasks with custom AI agents.

Based on your post, it sounds like you're spending too much time on [specific task]. I've built automation for similar workflows that reduced manual work by 70-90%.

**My process:**
1. Quick call to understand your workflow (15-30 min)
2. I propose a solution with clear pricing
3. Build and test with your feedback
4. Deliver with documentation

No long-term contracts - just results.

Would you be open to a quick call this week to explore if automation makes sense for your situation?

Andrew
